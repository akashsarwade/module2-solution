                        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low 
                        cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become 
                        prevalent in numerous cuisines.
                        Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, 
                        grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of 
                        the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. 
                        Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with 
                        lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat
